# Robocode
Robocode allows you create battle robots, place them in a virtual arena with other
Robocode bots, and let them fight it out to the finish.  Robocode is a great intro to Java coding concepts,
and allows for teaching a lot of interesting math concepts as well (coordinate plane, angles, degrees, radians,
heading, and bearing to name just a few).

- [Java With Robocode](https://github.com/rvacoderdojo/lessons/tree/master/robocode/java-with-robocode) Bots we've created in the dojo
- [Robomgr](https://github.com/rvacoderdojo/lessons/tree/master/robocode/robomgr) Robocode Bot Manager to support uploads into the battle arena at the dojo.
