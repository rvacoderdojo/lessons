# Intro to Java with Robocode

Robocode allows you create battle robots, place them in a virtual arena with other
Robocode bots, and let them fight it out to the finish.  Robocode is a great intro to Java coding concepts,
and allows for teaching a lot of interesting math concepts as well (coordinate plane, angles, degrees, radians,
heading, and bearing to name just a few).

Source code for the robots can be found in [``src/main/java``](https://github.com/rvacoderdojo/lessons/tree/master/robocode/java-with-robocode/src/main/java)

- [SimpleBot.java](https://github.com/rvacoderdojo/lessons/blob/master/robocode/java-with-robocode/src/main/java/coderdojo/bots/simple/SimpleBot.java)

## Building/Setup
This has been implemented as a Maven project to make it easier to build and manage in IDEs.  If you're using Eclipse
or IntelliJ/Idea just make sure you have [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) setup on your system, and Maven plugins installed
in your IDE.

From commandline, have [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) installed, and do a basic: ``mvn clean package``

For Robocode setup, see instructions in [Lesson 1](http://goo.gl/7ICTZ1)
