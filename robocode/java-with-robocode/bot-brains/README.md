# bot-brains
This is a collection of utility classes that are used to make it easier and more accessible for dojo ninjas to start
coding quickly with Robocode.  It houses and masks some of the complex or mundane aspects of building an intelligent
bot.  This code is too long to do in a single dojo session, so we will use it to teach Java and Object Oriented programming
concepts, but provide it in library form to let our coders concentrate on the
more interesting aspects of developing battle strategy and bots.

Ideas demonstrated and present in this code base include:
- Java Beans
    - [Example of Getters/Setters](https://github.com/rvacoderdojo/lessons/blob/master/robocode/java-with-robocode/bot-brains/src/main/java/coderdojo/bots/robobrain/EnemyInfo.java#L121)
- Logical Statements
- Data Structures like HashMaps and Lists
    - [HashMap Example with Comments](https://github.com/rvacoderdojo/lessons/blob/master/robocode/java-with-robocode/bot-brains/src/main/java/coderdojo/bots/robobrain/Brain.java#L17)
- Method Overloading
    - [Examples with Comments](https://github.com/rvacoderdojo/lessons/blob/master/robocode/java-with-robocode/bot-brains/src/main/java/coderdojo/bots/robobrain/Brain.java#L95)
- Polymorphism
    - [Example with Comments](https://github.com/rvacoderdojo/lessons/blob/master/robocode/java-with-robocode/bot-brains/src/main/java/coderdojo/bots/robobrain/Brain.java#L34)
- Enhanced For Loops
    - [Example on a Collection](https://github.com/rvacoderdojo/lessons/blob/master/robocode/java-with-robocode/bot-brains/src/main/java/coderdojo/bots/robobrain/scanners/LiveBotScanner.java#L22)

    - [Example on Varargs array](https://github.com/rvacoderdojo/lessons/blob/master/robocode/java-with-robocode/bot-brains/src/main/java/coderdojo/bots/robobrain/Brain.java#L80)
- Varargs

Comments highlighting these concepts are sprinkled throughout the code. Uses the above
keywords to string search through the code for detailed explanations of the concepts.
