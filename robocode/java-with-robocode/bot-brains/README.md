# bot-brains
This is a collection of utility classes that are used to make it easier and more accessible for dojo ninjas to start
coding quickly with Robocode.  It houses and masks some of the complex or mundane aspects of building an intelligent
bot.  This code is too long to do in a single dojo session, so we will use it to teach concepts, but provide it in
library form to let the kid concentrate on the more interesting aspects of developing battle strategy and bots.

Ideas demonstrated and present in this code base include:
- Java Beans
- Data Structures like HashMaps and Lists
- Logical Statements
- Method Overloading
- Polymorphism
- Enhanced For Loops

Comments highlighting these concepts are sprinkled throughout the code.
