# dojobots
This houses our growing collection of Robocode bots developed in the dojo.

- [SimpleBot.java](https://github.com/rvacoderdojo/lessons/blob/master/robocode/java-with-robocode/dojobots/src/main/java/coderdojo/bots/simple/SimpleBot.java)
    - This very basic bot is still fairly effective.  It shows the basic concepts of coding in Java and using Robocode.

- [SmarterBot.java](https://github.com/rvacoderdojo/lessons/blob/master/robocode/java-with-robocode/dojobots/src/main/java/coderdojo/bots/smart/SmarterBot.java)
    - This more advanced bot uses the code in the [bot-brains](https://github.com/rvacoderdojo/lessons/blob/master/robocode/java-with-robocode/bot-brains/) library to
    remember details that it has learned from it's environment.

Note: To run these bots you will need to include the "bot-brains" jar file in your Robocode classpath somewhere.
