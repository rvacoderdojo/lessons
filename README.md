# Coder Dojo Lessons

This is a repository for sample code from various lessons we've taught at the dojo.

## Robocode
Robocode allows you create battle robots, place them in a virtual arena with other
Robocode bots, and let them fight it out to the finish.  Robocode is a great intro to Java coding concepts,
and allows for teaching a lot of interesting math concepts as well (coordinate plane, angles, degrees, radians,
heading, and bearing to name just a few).

- [Java With Robocode](https://github.com/rvacoderdojo/lessons/tree/master/robocode/java-with-robocode) Bots we've created in the dojo
- [Robomgr](https://github.com/rvacoderdojo/lessons/tree/master/robocode/robomgr) Robocode Bot Manager to support uploads into the battle arena at the dojo.

## Greenfoot
Greenfoot is a great tool to help bridge kids from Scratch to Java.

- [Robo Tanks](https://github.com/rvacoderdojo/lessons/tree/master/greenfoot/robo-tanks) Inheritance concepts
- [Balloon Clapper](https://github.com/rvacoderdojo/lessons/tree/master/greenfoot/balloon-clapper) Using sound to play a game.

## Minecraft
I'm sure you know what Minecraft is.  This section will hold projects and lessons associated with modding
Minecraft.

- [Dojo Forge](https://github.com/rvacoderdojo/lessons/tree/master/minecraft/dojo-forge) Our First foray into Minecraft modding with a few simple recipes and an unbreakable block.

We hope you find this useful. Feel free to pull and remix these apps as you see fit.
