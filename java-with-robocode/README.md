# Intro to Java with Robocode

This contains source code examples from the RVA Coder Dojo to show how to develop robots in Robocode.

Source code for the robots can be found in [``src/main/java``](https://github.com/rvacoderdojo/lessons/tree/master/java-with-robocode/src/main/java)

This has been implemented as a Maven project to make it easier to build and manage in IDEs.
