PROJECT TITLE: Balloon Clapper
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:  This is a very simple Greenfoot project used in our Coder Dojo to introduce Greenfoot and have some fun.  Balloons can be added to the screen by clicking.  They will bounce off the bottom of the screen, but if they touch the top they will pop.  Gravity is controlled by how loud or quiet the room is.  (It uses the computer's microphone)
VERSION or DATE: 6/19/2014
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
AUTHORS: Macon Pegram
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Click the screen to add balloons.  Make noise to apply "anti-gravity", be quiet to allow gravity to take over.  If a balloon touches the top of the screen it pops.
