## Balloon Clapper
=======

This project is a very basic introduction to Greenfoot.  

**A microphone is required for this app to work properly.**

The application will start with a balloon centered in the screen.  Once running the balloon will begin to drop as gravity is applied to it.  If it hits the bottom it will bounce and lose a little momentum.  

The application uses the computer's microphone to monitor sound levels. If sound is detected, a small amount of anti-gravity is applied proportional to how loud the sound is.   Once sound stops, gravity slowly takes over.

If a balloon hits the top of the screen it will pop.  

You can add new balloons by clicking on the screen.
